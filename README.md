# Playing Ghostbusters Theme with Ardunio Uno and DFPlayer Mini

This was made as part of a Ghostbusters DIY costume for Halloween 2024.

The code and electronics demonstrates how music can be played from a microSD card using an Arduino Uno (an ATmega328P-based microcontroller), a DFPlayer Mini MP3/WAV audio decoder, a 30mm 2-watt speaker, and a 9-volt battery.
